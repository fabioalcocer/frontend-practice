I learned about the vertical-align CSS property, and how to display an overlay image/text on hover.

- [W3Schools How To - Image Hover Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - Tried things for an hour, then found about this which helped me make the image view overlay.
